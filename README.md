# Car performance simulator
Android app that simulates a car performance using various car parameter values defined by user. It enables user to store multiple car models and to simulate
performance of each of them.

The simulator takes into account various car parameters like car weight, drag coefficient, front area, gear ratios, engine power at different engine speeds, etc.
But it does not take into account all parameters that are needed to make this a serious and accurate simulation of the real car performance. For example, it does not
take into account friction between car tires and surface - this means that no wheelspin is simulated, all power gets transfered from car wheels to the road. 

This simulator is intended to be used for fun or to learn how various car parameters affect car performance.
